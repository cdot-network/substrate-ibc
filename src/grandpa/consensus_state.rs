// TODO: This struct is defined by grandpa client and it should be replaced with a serialized bytes.
// Also the ConsensusState MUST define a getTimestamp() method which returns the timestamp associated with that consensus state.

/// # Parameters
/// - `set_id`: This parameter will be encoded into payload with other data byt the function "localized_payload_with_buffer<E: Encode>". Note that according to the comments of method (https://crates.parity.io/sc_finality_grandpa/trait.GrandpaApi.html#method.generate_key_ownership_proof), current implementations ignore this parameter.
/// - `authorities`: A list of Grandpa authorities with associated weights.
/// - `commitment_root`: State root of a substrate block.
